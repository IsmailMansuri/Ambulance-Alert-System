# Ambulance Alert
This device allows ambulances or other emergency vehicles to communicate with traffic ahead of them, allowing the traffic more time to exit the emergency vehicle's path, awarding quicker arrival times for the emergency vehicle.

# Motivation
Our group noticed that tracking technologies used by ambulances dated back to the 1980's, and we wanted to improve upon that and somehow allow ambulances an easier journey to get to their patients.
